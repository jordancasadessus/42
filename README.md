# Welcome to my GitHub

Here are the projects I did at school 42 that I enjoyed the most and on which I invested the most time and effort.
They were done in major collaboration with [Paloouf](https://github.com/Paloouf).

## [FdF](https://github.com/jordancasadessus/fdf)
This project was my first encounter with graphic projects. The goal was to retrieve a text file containing altitudes and colors, then display the result in 3D wireframe.
We took the liberty of adding colors based on altitude when no color is specified by the map.

## [Philosphers](https://github.com/jordancasadessus/philo)
The goal of this project was to simulate philosophers who must share forks to eat, using threads or mutexes.
The challenge was to synchronize each one so that a resource was not read and modified at the same time, and to optimize the resources to ensure the program ran smoothly.

## [Cub3D](https://github.com/jordancasadessus/cub3d)
The goal of this project was to introduce us to 3D, particularly raycasting. The mandatory part required us to implement movement, different walls based on their orientation, doors, and animated sprites.
We added features such as sprites representing enemies with basic AI, an objective to reach, a menu with difficulty selection, and a game over screen.
This is the project we enjoyed working on and investing ourselves in the most.

## [Ft_irc](https://github.com/Paloouf/ft_irc)
This was our first major project in C++. We had to create a server that strictly adhered to the IRC protocol, then add a bot.

## [Ft_trancendance](https://github.com/CartelGames/ft_transcendence)
The final project of the core curriculum. The goal was to create a website where you could play Pong, then add a certain number of optional modules. Among these, we decided to add 3D using three.js, a second game, power-ups, the ability to play online, and more.
